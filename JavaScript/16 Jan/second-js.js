    Logic

    i = 1, 1 <= 5 -> True -> Print Akshay -> Value will be incremented to 2
    i = 2; 2 <= 5 -> True -> Print Akshay -> Value will be incremented to 3
    i = 3; 3 <= 5 -> True -> Print Akshay -> Value will be incremented to 4
    i = 4; 4 <= 5 -> True -> Print Akshay -> Value will be incremented to 5
    i = 5; 5 <= 5 -> True -> Print Akshay -> Value will be incremented to 6
    i = 6; 6 <= 5 -> False -> Exit from Loop without printing anything
